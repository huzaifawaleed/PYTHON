DAY 1:
Introduction

DAY 2: 
Python prpgrams (exsiting)

DAY 3:
MODULES IN PYTHON
Module is like a code library which is used to borrow others code in our program. 
There are two types of modules in python:

Built in Modules - These modules are ready to import why bcz these are already installed. 

External Modules - These modules are others code that we use in our program with the help of pip command to install.

THE pip COMMAND
It can be used as a package manager pip to install a python module. 

DAY 4:
source in file DAY4.

DAY 5:
source in file DAY5.

DAY 6:
VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES.

VARIABLES is used store a value

DATA TYPES identifies which type if value variable is holding like number, string etc.

LIST: MUTABLE
it is a ordered collection of data in which elements separated by comma and enclosed in a square brackets. LIST value can be changed after creation.

TUPLE: IMMUTABLE
it is a ordered collection of data in which elements separated by comma and enclosed in a square brackets. TUPLE value cannot be changed after creation.

DICTIONARY:
it is unordered colllection of data of key value pairs "name":"huzaifa" enclosed in curly brackets and value in double quotes.

DAY 7:
Exercise 1 Calculator.

DAY 8:
Solution Exercise 1.

DAY 9:
TYPE CASTING OR CONVERSION.
The conversion of one data type into another is known as type casting or conversion.

There are two types of type casting.

Explicit conversion.
The conversion that is done by developer is known as Explicit conversion.
Example:
This is string now
a = "1"
b = "2"
Now this is Number
print(int(a) + int(b))

Implicit conversion.
Data types in python have not same level some is higher some is lower in implicit if the one variable of different data type then python automatically converts into higher level.

DAY 10:
User Input.
Getting user input there are some thing to know that in python while taking user input the by default value of data type is STRING. so if you are taking a number as input it is necessary to write the data type like INT.


DAY 11:
STRINGS ARE IMMUTABLE WHEN WE APPLY METHOD ON A STRING IT RETURNS A NEW STRING THEY ARE NOT CHANGEABLE.
STRINGS.
Anything that you enclose in a single or double quotes is called string.



DAY 12:
STRING SLICING.
Indexing.
Accessing the characters starting from 0.


DAY 13:
STRINGS METHODS.
Practice source file.


DAY 14.
IF ELSE STATEMENTS.
Solve questions source file.
