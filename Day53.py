# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# and returns a list where each number is squared.

# [2, 3, 4, 5]
# (Expected answer: 120)

# ðŸ”¹ 4. Map + Filter
# Given a list of words:
# ["apple", "banana", "pear", "kiwi", "grapes"]

# Then, use map to convert them to uppercase.

# ðŸ”¹ 5. Map + Reduce
# You have a list of prices in dollars:
# [20.5, 10.75, 5.99, 12.30]
# Use map to add a 10% tax to each price.
# Then use reduce to find the total bill amount.
